# Router simulation
The program was created as a mandatory exercise in the subject IN2140 - Introduction to Operating Systems and Data Communication.

The program will simulate a system used to manage routers. The program will therefore store and process basic information about the routers. The program accepts two files. A file that describes the routers and links between them, and another file with commands to execute.
